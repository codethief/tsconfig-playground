This sample project is based on the folder structure & configs generated by `npm
create vue@latest`, and has been modified to use TSC project references
consistently (e.g. tests _reference_ the production code / code-under-test but
do not `include` it).

# Current status
VSCode with Vue extension v2.1.2 complains about imports from `HelloWorld.vue`
in `HelloWorld.spec.ts`. Bug report filed here:
https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools/issues/4750.

`pnpm run type-check` works as expected, though.
